# What We Store and Why:

- User IDs of bot users are stored to retain user-selected bot settings, enforce server, global, tip (feedback), and guild owner blacklist systems, and manage any reports filed on individuals.

- Server IDs of all servers Venture is in are stored to maintain specifically configured bot settings for each server and to keep track of Venture's presence across servers.

- Channel IDs of any channel listed, set to receive vent approval messages, or set to log user-deleted vents are stored to ensure smooth operation of Venture in all servers without interference.

- Command logs for all application (slash) commands used by Venture and corresponding content from user input fields are stored. This information is retained to verify the integrity of requested content and to assist in handling reports, as well as ensuring compliance with third-party APIs when accessing data.

- Vent content of all messages sent through /anon-vent, including message content and files, is stored. This is done to promptly address any offensive, discriminatory, or otherwise undesirable content sent through Venture. This data is also stored in our database and is used for vent reply notifications. (Note that data is encrypted within the database and can only be accessed with proper credentials)

# Who Has Access To The Data?

- The only users with access to the previously mentioned data are bot staff and developers for Venture, server owners/staff of servers that use Venture do not and will **NEVER** have access to the user information associated with your vents ***unless a report is filed on you, or our team feels you or another individual is in immediate physical danger.*** In the event of a report being filed on a user, user information may be granted to server staff if the report is deemed valid and a users immediate safety is in danger, or another one of our terms is being violated.

- Venture staff may send vent content to be analyzed by a trusted company such as Google under specific conditions such as translating vent **content** to English or another language, this may be done to ensure Venture staff can read the content in their primary language and make sure it's compliant with our [ToS](https://github.com/poperoni304/Venture-Policies/blob/02e9b68d4245b2fb33a17570c8b525a286284a99/ToS.md). Doing the following is not a decision taken lightly and we will only do so under specific circumstances. (Only vent content may be analyzed, no user information will be associated)
